## Billy

Billy is a POS application i'm building for my coffee shop. Yes, i know there are applications available. I wanted something slick and opensource. Im making this available for everyone to use. 

Billy is built on Tauri, Rust and Next.js. I didnt want to use electron for the application due to the launch speed benefits. I am trying to keep this application completely offline where eventually i might provide an option for cloud backups

The application is at its early stages and I am open to allow contributors, right now this is an indie project.


## Getting started

```
npm install

npm run tauri dev
```
